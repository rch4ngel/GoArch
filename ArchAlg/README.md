# ArchAlg

ArchAlg is a project that will showcase the design and development of algorithms 
in Go. Algorithms implemented will be constructed in accordance to the learning
of algorithms taught in the book "Introduction To Algorithms" 
by  Thomas H. Cormen, 
    Charles E. Leiserson, 
    Ronald L. Rivest,
    Clifford Stein
    
The Goal Of this Project is to not only implement the algorithms but to create
a front end to show a beautiful representation of the results.
